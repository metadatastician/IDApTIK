# Fixture coverage for scripts/vendor_bevy_winit_check.sh (issues #105/#102).
#
# Every gate needs a clean fixture that passes and firing fixtures that fail
# for the intended reason. The parity checks run against a locally staged
# "published" crate (the vendored tree with the documented feature split
# reverted), and the watch checks against staged sparse-index JSONL, so this
# test needs no network. Missing tools must fail the gate, never skip it.
