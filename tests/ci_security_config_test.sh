# Offline regression coverage for this repository's CI/CD security configuration.
#
# The production inputs are declarative YAML, so this suite checks their
# security-relevant structure directly and then mutates temporary copies to
# prove each assertion can fail. It needs no network, no action runner, and no
# project toolchain — bash, POSIX awk, sed, and the files themselves.
#
# Originally added by PR #143. Rewritten here for three measured reasons:
#
# 1. IT WAS NEVER INVOKED. PR #143 committed 267 lines at mode 100755 and wired
#    them into nothing — no justfile recipe, no workflow step. That is the
#    estate's recurring vacuous-gate shape and it is strictly worse than no
#    test, because a reader assumes the CI configuration is guarded. Issue #141
#    is the same defect in tests/abi_authority_pin_test.sh; both are wired in
#    the same change. `just ci-security-config-test` and the `fixtures-and-must`
#    job in .github/workflows/ci.yml now call this file.
#
# 2. IT FAILED ON A CLEAN TREE. Its own "init and analyze cannot drift to
#    different revisions" mutant did not fire, because the mutant used the regex
#    interval `/@[0-9a-f]{40}/` and mawk — /usr/bin/awk on a default
#    Debian/Ubuntu, and the awk in this repository's development containers —
#    does not implement `{n}` intervals. The substitution silently did nothing,
#    the mutant equalled the original, and the suite reported one FAIL out of
#    eleven. Nothing caught that, because nothing ran it. Every regex here is
#    now POSIX: no `{n}` intervals, no gawk three-argument match().
#
# 3. ITS CODEQL POLICY WAS WRONG, AND BEING WRONG KILLED THE WORKFLOW. It
#    required `github/codeql-action` refs to be bare 40-hex commit SHAs. But
#    .github/workflows/actions.lock is authoritative for what runs, and GitHub
#    enforces it per workflow path at STARTUP: a ref the lockfile does not
#    record under that path makes the run unstartable — zero jobs, no log, only
#    "This run likely failed because of a workflow file issue." PR #143 obeyed
#    this suite, re-pinned both refs from `@v4.38.0` to a SHA, and every CodeQL
#    run from 2026-09-23T10:38Z onward rendered no verdict at all — while
#    `code_scanning` is a required rule on main. The assertion below now checks
#    what actually pins: the ref must be recorded in the lockfile under this
#    workflow's own path, and that record must resolve to a sha1-<40hex>
#    commit. A bare SHA in the YAML satisfies it only if the lockfile records
#    that same SHA.
#
# Checks are grouped and every group prints its denominator, because a check
# that examined nothing and reported "ok" is the defect this file was written
# to prevent.

# v4.38.2 in codeql.yml without touching actions.lock -- which Dependabot
# cannot do -- and the lock-sync gate added three minutes earlier by PR #147
