//! Delay-based lockstep for live seats (issue #7, interactive-client slice).
//!
//! The batch machine in [`crate::session`] streams a whole script, then runs.
//! A live seat cannot: input arrives in real time, so each seat samples its
//! input at local step `T` and schedules it for execution tick `T +
//! input_delay`, giving every command `input_delay` ticks of wire time to
//! reach the peer before either side needs it. Pacing hides latency; nobody
//! rolls back.
//!
//! Two protocol facts carry the whole design:
//!
//! - **Commands are sparse, so completeness needs a watermark.** Silence at
//!   tick `T` is indistinguishable from a command still in flight. Each seat
//!   therefore follows its sends with a `net:commit { through }` — over the
//!   ordered transport, receiving the commit proves every command `at <=
//!   through` already arrived. A seat executes tick `T` only when both its own
//!   and its peer's watermarks cover `T`.
//! - **Uncommitted commands did not happen.** A seat that dies between a
//!   command and its commit leaves an orphan in the survivor's buffer that the
//!   rejoining seat (a fresh process) knows nothing about; if the survivor
//!   kept it, the rejoiner would resample that tick and the two sims would
//!   silently diverge. [`LockstepCore::on_peer_lost`] prunes everything at or
//!   above the peer's watermark, and the resync payload carries only committed
//!   history — both sides then agree exactly on which inputs exist.
//!
//! This module is sans-IO on purpose: it consumes facts (`on_peer_*`) and
//! emits [`Outgoing`] values, and never touches a socket. The unit tests below
//! prove determinism by running two cores over an in-memory wire — including
//! a mid-run death and [`Resync`] — and asserting both event logs equal the
//! reference `headless::simulate` run byte-for-byte. The async driver in
//! [`crate::live`] then carries the same machine over the real relay.
