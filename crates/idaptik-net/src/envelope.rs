//! The relay envelope and the `net:` control vocabulary.
//!
//! A relayed `"command"` payload is the serde `Command` JSON (tagged `"cmd"`,
//! ADR-0005) plus up to two envelope keys the sim never sees:
//!
//! - `"seq"` — strictly-increasing per seat; the relay acknowledges-and-drops
//!   duplicates and strips the key before relaying (ADR-0005).
//! - `"at"` — the lockstep tick this command is scheduled for. Authored and
//!   consumed by clients only; the relay relays it untouched without reading
//!   it (it strips exactly `"seq"`), and serde's internally-tagged decoding
//!   ignores it, so the typed payload stays byte-compatible. This is the
//!   scheduling seam ADR-0005 predicted would attach "when real clients
//!   arrive" (amended there, 2026-07-21).
//!
//! Control messages between the two net layers ride the relay's `"event"`
//! pass-through, namespaced `"net:*"` so they can never collide with the sim's
//! `Event` alphabet (Rust variant tags are `UpperCamelCase`; `:` cannot appear
//! in one). They are consumed by `idaptik-net` and never fed to the sim.
