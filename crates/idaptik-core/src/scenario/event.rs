//! Typed events — the event-sourced spine of the scenario.
//!
//! Every `logEvent` and state transition in the prototype becomes a typed
//! [`Event`]. The ordered `Vec<Event>` a run produces is the canonical
//! deterministic artifact. Human log lines are a pure *view*: [`log_view`] maps
//! an event to an optional [`LogLine`]. Structural / telemetry events return
//! `None` (they still exist in the event stream, they just aren't rendered).
//!
//! Log text uses this crate's own deterministic formatter (fixed decimals via
//! Rust formatting), **not** JS `toFixed` — the goldens are ours.
