//! Render-time interpolation: double-buffered visual state, sampled with a
//! fractional alpha so a fixed-rate simulation renders smoothly on a display
//! that does not share its rate.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The simulation advances in whole ticks at [`TICK_DT`](crate::scenario::TICK_DT)
//! (60 Hz). A frontend renders whenever the display asks it to. If a renderer
//! reads the live simulation state every frame, a 144 Hz display shows the same
//! position for a varying number of frames and motion visibly judders. The fix
//! is to keep the last two simulated states and draw somewhere between them.
//!
//! # The invariant
//!
//! **Interpolation is render-only. No value produced here may ever flow back
//! into simulation state.** Everything in this module is a pure function of two
//! already-simulated states; nothing in it is reachable from
//! [`GhostLobbySim::tick`](crate::scenario::GhostLobbySim::tick). Determinism
//! (ADR-0004) depends on that separation, and the `replay_determinism` and
//! `snapshot_equivalence` suites are what hold it.
//!
//! # Zero allocation
//!
//! [`DoubleBuffer`] is two inline fixed-size arrays. `commit` is a copy. There
//! is no `Vec`, no `Box` and no allocation on any path here, so nothing in the
//! per-frame or per-tick path can stall on the allocator.
//!
//! # Extraction note
//!
//! This module is deliberately at the crate root rather than under `scenario/`:
//! [`Pose`], [`Blend`] and [`DoubleBuffer`] know nothing about IDApTIK and are
//! intended to lift out wholesale. Only [`VisualSlot`], [`poses_of`] and
//! [`door_opens_of`] are game-specific. See `ENGINE_EXTRACTION_NOTES.md`.

/// * **The interior uses the one-term form.** The symmetric-looking
