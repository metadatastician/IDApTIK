//! The sim driver: [`GhostLobbySim`] as a Bevy resource, stepped at a fixed
//! 60 Hz from a queued [`Command`] stream — the same wire API the TUI speaks.
//!
//! This module is deliberately render-free: a headless test `App` can add
//! [`SimDriverPlugin`] alone and drive [`FixedUpdate`] by hand, which is how
//! the frontend-parity test in `tests/parity.rs` works.
