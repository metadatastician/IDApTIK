# check-lock-sync.sh — prove `.github/workflows/actions.lock` agrees with the
# workflow YAML, in both directions, before GitHub proves it by refusing to
# start the run.
#
# ── THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# GitHub enforces the Actions lockfile at STARTUP, keyed BY WORKFLOW PATH. A
# step-level `uses:` ref that the lockfile does not record under that same
# workflow's own path makes the run unstartable: ZERO jobs are created, there
# is no log, no annotation, and no red X on any job — only
# "This run likely failed because of a workflow file issue." A required check
# that never posts is worse than a red one, because a branch ruleset waiting on
# `code_scanning` is satisfied by nothing and nobody sees the hole.
#
# This repository is a measured case, not a hypothetical. On 2026-09-23 PR #143
# rewrote codeql.yml's two refs from `@v4.38.0` to a bare commit SHA. The
# lockfile still recorded `github/codeql-action@v4.38.0`. Every CodeQL run from
# 2026-09-23T10:38Z onward concluded `startup_failure` with `jobs: 0`, across
# eight runs and four branches, while CI, Pages, Creusot and the secret scanner
# all stayed green — so the tree looked healthy. Dependabot then bumped the SHA
# twice more (#145, #146), each time re-breaking a file that was already broken.
#
# Dependabot rewrites refs in workflow YAML and cannot touch the lockfile, so
# every grouped `github-actions` update desynchronises a repository that has
# not got a gate. Regenerating the lockfile once buys exactly one week. Hence
# this script, and `.github/workflows/lock-sync-gate.yml`, which carries no
# `uses:` of its own and so is structurally immune to the failure it detects.
#
# ── HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM metadatastician/burble's scripts/check-lock-sync.sh ─
#
# Same job, two deliberate deviations, both measured rather than preferred:
#
# 1. POSIX awk only. burble's script uses gawk's three-argument match() and
#    `{n}` regex intervals. Neither is POSIX, and neither exists in mawk, which
#    is /usr/bin/awk on a default Debian/Ubuntu and in this repository's own
#    development containers. AGENTS.md's rule is that a check must be runnable
#    where the work is done; a gate that only runs on a CI image is a gate whose
#    mutants you cannot exercise locally. This repository already paid that
#    price twice: tests/abi_authority_pin_test.sh died with an awk syntax error
#    under mawk, and tests/ci_security_config_test.sh had a mutant that
#    silently did not fire because mawk ignores `{40}`. Both are fixed in the
#    same change as this script.
#
# 2. An unonboarded workflow is judged by its REFS, not condemned outright.
#    burble's script fails any workflow with no lockfile entry. In this
#    repository that would fail two workflows that are measurably healthy:
#    abi-conformance.yml and creusot-proof.yml have never appeared in the
#    lockfile's `workflows:` map, both carry step-level `uses:`, and both run —
#    including creusot-proof.yml straight through PR #145, which rewrote its
#    `actions/upload-artifact` SHA. The difference between them and codeql.yml
#    is that every one of their refs is an immutable 40-hex commit. So:
#      * unonboarded + all refs immutable 40-hex  -> NOTICE, with the count
#      * unonboarded + any movable ref (tag/branch) -> FAIL
#    The FAIL arm is the shape that killed burble's joinery-native.yml
#    (`actions/checkout@v7.0.1` with no lockfile entry). That attribution is an
#    INFERENCE from burble#223's write-up, not a measurement made here, and it
#    is labelled as such in the output.
#
# Exit 0 only when every check passes. There is no warn-only mode for a FAIL
# arm: a desync means GitHub will refuse to start the run.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-lock-sync.sh                # check this repository
#   scripts/check-lock-sync.sh DIR            # check another workflows dir
