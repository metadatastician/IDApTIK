# Gate for the vendored bevy_winit feature patch (issue #105).
#
# PR #104 vendored the published bevy_winit source so IDApTIK can select
# Winit's title-free Wayland CSD feature without the ab_glyph -> ttf-parser
# dependency path that Bevy's `wayland` feature otherwise forces. A vendored
# crate receives no upstream fixes, so this gate makes the maintenance
# obligation in vendor/README.md executable:
#
#   parity — the vendored copy is byte-identical to the published crate
#            (source, licences, README) and its manifest differs ONLY by the
#            documented feature split. Run this on every Bevy upgrade.
#   graph  — the resolved workspace graph contains no font-parser crates and
#            activates the title-free CSD feature on bevy_winit/winit.
#   watch  — inspect published bevy_winit releases for the retirement
#            condition (independently selectable Wayland CSD features).
#            Exits non-zero once upstream makes the vendor patch removable,
#            so the patch cannot silently outlive its welcome.
#
# Offline fixtures: set IDAPTIK_BEVY_WINIT_CRATE to a local .crate tarball
# (parity), IDAPTIK_BEVY_WINIT_INDEX to a local sparse-index JSONL file
# (watch), and/or IDAPTIK_BEVY_WINIT_METADATA to a local `cargo metadata`
# JSON document (graph). All default to the live sources.
