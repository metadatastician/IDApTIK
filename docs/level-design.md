# Level design integration — 2.5D side-on, multi-floor, UMS-wired

This is the synthesis view: how the pieces that landed on `main` combine into one
coherent level-design picture — a **2.5D side-on** cross-section, a **multi-floor
Exchange House** building, and procedural **wiring driven via UMS**. It is a map of
the seams, not new design; each section links the module that owns the truth.

## The spine: definition-as-data over a deterministic sim

Everything below hangs off one decision (ADR-0004): a level is **data**, and the
simulation is a **pure, event-sourced function** of `(definition, config, seed,
command stream)`. The ordered `Event` stream is the canonical artifact; the same
`Command`/`Event` wire is spoken by every frontend and by the multiplayer relay.

Consequences that make the rest of this document possible:

- Every layer — layout, building, network, actors, companion — is **serde
  definition-as-data** with a committed golden JSON and a round-trip test. Content
  can therefore be authored (or generated) *outside* the engine and loaded in.
- Determinism means the renderer, the TUI, and the relay are all **thin views**
  over the same run — none of them can disagree with gameplay truth.

## 2.5D side-on layout

`crates/idaptik-bevy/src/scene.rs` renders the *side-on 2.5D cross-section of the
building — Gunpoint-like, flat-shaded quads for readability over art*. Scenario
coordinates are canvas-style (x right, y **down**, floor line at `world.floor`);
`SceneMap` converts to Bevy's y-up. Rooms are one horizontal row of flat quads,
laid out purely from the room definitions; doors slide up out of the walk line,
and camera view-cones are drawn from the sim's exact sweep formula
(`CAM_SWEEP_W`/`CAM_SWEEP_A`) so the picture can never disagree with detection.

The **multi-floor seam is already in the mapping**: `SceneMap::row_lift` stacks
additional floor rows vertically (`ROW_STACK = 440.0`) *"so the coming multi-floor
Exchange House building runtime slots in as extra rows without touching the
mapping."* The renderer is a pure view: `SimDriverPlugin` steps `GhostLobbySim` at
`SIM_HZ = 60` in `FixedUpdate`, folds a `CommandQueue` into a `TickInput`, and all
sync systems read `sim.state()`/`sim.definition()` (ADR-0003/0006).

## The reference floor: Ghost Lobby

`crates/idaptik-core/src/scenario/ghost_lobby.rs` — *Envelope 001 — Ghost Lobby*
(`scenario_id: envelope-001-ghost-lobby`, wire tag `idaptik-ghost-lobby-v2`). A
single-floor asymmetric infiltration:

- **Roles.** *Infiltrator* (moves through five rooms), *Hacker* (remote support —
  opens doors, cuts lights), and **Billy**, a guard NPC whose belief meter
  *interprets player behaviour* to decide what was stolen.
- **Objectives** (`ObjectiveKind`): `Note` (secure the contact note),
  `Misdirect` (convince Billy it was the drive), `Exit` (service exit / laundry
  chute). The win is **misdirection**, not mere escape.
- **World.** Five contiguous rooms tiling `x ∈ [20, 1260)` on the floor line
  `y = 585`: `kitchen`, `hall`, `office` (the lit "USB trap"), `laundry`, `exit`;
  doors D1–D4 on interior boundaries; cameras (laundry's is `stale` and never
  detects). The constants are dual-homed — `pub const` source of truth projected
  into the definition, with a `json_roundtrip` test asserting fidelity.

## Multi-floor: the Exchange House building runtime

`crates/idaptik-core/src/scenario/building/` generalises a scenario into *one floor
of a data-defined building* (`BuildingDefinition`, format `idaptik-scenario/1`):

- **`FloorDef`** — `level: i32` (storey; ground = 0, service negative), a
  `FloorKind` of `Standard` / `Billy` / `Service`, its `rooms`, and an optional
  embedded `scenario: ScenarioDefinition`. Validation enforces **exactly one
  `Billy` floor** per building.
- **`PortalDef`** — `Door` / `Stair` / `Lift` / `Ladder` / `Vent`, bidirectional,
  with a `travel_time`, an optional `lock { controller }` (a network node
  disengages it), and an optional `circuit` (an unpowered portal can't be
  traversed; **lifts must declare a circuit**).
- **`CircuitDef`** — a power feed keyed to a `zone`; cutting its `source`
  de-powers every portal and controller drawing from it.
- **`ZoneDef`** — a named region with a dotted `/24 subnet`, mapped **1:1 to a
  netsim segment**.

**"Ghost Lobby as one floor"** is literal: `FloorDef::from_scenario` embeds a whole
`ScenarioDefinition`, and validation (`scenario.rooms_match`) enforces that the
floor's rooms mirror the scenario's exactly; `scenario_floor_portals()` projects
the scenario's *interior* doors into building portals (a door on the world's outer
edge projects nothing — it is the scenario's own extraction surface). In
`exchange_house.json` the stack is `service` (−1: plant, crawl), `exchange`
(0: lobby/hall/tellers), `office` (1: landing/bullpen/manager), `ghost-lobby`
(2: `kind: Billy`, the full embedded scenario + four interior door-portals). Entry
is `exchange/lobby`; portals include lifts on circuit `main`, stairs, a service
ladder, and vents (one into the ghost-lobby laundry).

`BuildingSim` is again a pure function of `(definition, command stream)` — commands
`Traverse(PortalId)` / `Actuate(String)`; events `Entered` / `TraversalDenied` /
`Unlocked` / `PowerCut` / `ActuationFailed`, with deny reasons
`UnknownPortal` / `NotAdjacent` / `Locked` / `Unpowered`. It exports five surfaces
(definition, runtime snapshot, a legacy flat level config, an after-action
debrief, and the combined export), and a deterministic physical graph
(`reachable_rooms()`, Dijkstra `shortest_path()`).

## The wiring and plumbing: the grounded network

`crates/idaptik-core/src/netsim/` is *one vantage-keyed graph running from the wider
internet down to the devices in the room the infiltrator is standing in*. This is
the "wiring/plumbing" a level contains, and most of it is **derived, not authored**
(`scenario/floor_graph.rs`):

- **Devices** (`device.rs`, `DeviceKind`): Laptop, Router, Server, IotCamera,
  Terminal, PowerStation, Ups, Firewall, SmartDoor, Camera, Lock, Elevator, Light,
  Sensor, Substation — each with an ordered `SecurityLevel`
  (Open < Weak < Medium < Strong) and an `Actuation` (HoldDoor, DisengageLock,
  LoopCamera, CallElevator, KillLights, CutPower, MuteSensor, RunVacuum, …).
- **Derivation.** Only the network *backbone* is hand-authored (in
  `ghost_lobby_floor.json` / `config/ghost_lobby_floor.ncl`); every fixture is
  derived from the scenario `def`: each door → a weak `SmartDoor`, each room → a
  `Light`, each camera → a `Camera` on the shared `security` segment, the vacuum →
  a `Sensor`. Every fixture draws from a building `feed` fed by a `substation`, so
  **cutting the substation cascades to the whole floor** (test
  `cutting_the_substation_cascades_to_every_fixture`).
- **Vantages** give the two seats different attack surfaces: the hacker plays from
  a `Van` (higher reach, lower physical risk); an infiltrator standing in a room
  gets an `Inside` vantage on that room's segment (short reach, high risk). A level
  offers distinct lines — a one-hop **building line** vs a two-hop **upstream power
  line** to the substation.

This grounded-network fusion is what took the scenario wire format to `v2`.

## Actors as data ("Billy as data")

`crates/idaptik-core/src/scenario/actor/` ports *enemies as data*
(`idaptik-actors/1`). An `ActorArchetype` is 29 scalar FSM `stats` (`StatId`) plus
per-object `InterestProfile`s; a `Modifier` is an ordered list of `StatOp`
(`Add`/`Mul`/`Set`) that `compose()` applies deterministically (unknown ids are a
typed `ComposeError`, never a panic). **Billy** is projected from the same
`scenario::constants` numbers, expressed as data; his interests encode the decoy
economy (`note` = `Objective` signal 0.9; `usb` = `Decoy` signal 0.75). The default
registry ships Billy plus canonical `veteran` and `skittish` modifiers — the unit
from which UMS actor packs extend.

## The companion seam: Moletaire

`crates/idaptik-core/src/companion/` is Moletaire, the robotic-mole companion
(`idaptik-moletaire/1`), a deterministic port (typed `MoleCommand`/`MoleEvent`, one
seeded `Mulberry32` stream): depth-based movement, a gravity-model `hunger` system
that periodically resists the controller, seven equipment slots, and a five-slot
**coprocessor** augment bay (AudioSynthesiser, PathOptimiser, SignalProcessor,
VibrationAnalyser, StabilisationCore, each on a four-rung Stock→MK-III ladder).

**Status — seam, not yet wired.** Moletaire is deliberately standalone: a hosting
floor would drive it *through the typed boundary only* (`SynthSoundPlayed` → dogs
within 250px investigate; `VibrationDetected` → the hacker's view;
`UndergroundScanComplete` → a scan overlay). It is landed and test-covered as a
module, but **not yet integrated into `GhostLobbySim`** — treat it as a ready seam.

## The UMS seam: where procedural content plugs in

UMS (the Unified Modding Studio) is **not a code dependency** here — it is a
content/DLC **load seam**. Procedural generation lives *above* this crate; the
crate owns the format gate and validation. Three parallel, version-gated entry
points:

| Payload | Entry point | Format |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Building / scenario-definition | `scenario/building/mod.rs::load_building` | `idaptik-scenario/1` |
| Actor pack | `scenario/actor/mod.rs::load_actor_pack` | `idaptik-actors/1` |
| Companion | companion definition-as-data | `idaptik-moletaire/1` |

Each `load_*` **format-gates on `payload.format` then validates** before the runtime
trusts the content. The building model is also the ground truth for an
`idaptik-edit/1` **edit-script contract** (metadatastician/idaptik-ums) whose verbs
(add/move/remove floors, rooms, portals, circuits, zones) target exactly these ids
and shapes: *"the ids and shapes here are that contract's ground truth."* There is
no in-repo `dlc-manifest` or procedural generator — that is UMS-side, and it feeds
these validated load points.

## Multiplayer and host window

- **Relay (ADR-0005, landed).** The Elixir `SessionChannel` is **relay-only**: it
  fans byte-preserving `command`/`event` wire enums between the two seats and reads
  only the routing tag. Determinism (ADR-0004) makes lockstep sound, so no
  authoritative host process is needed; the relay stays transport-agnostic.
- **Host + transport (ADR-0006, design-accepted, deferred).** The plan wraps the
  Bevy frontend in the **gossamer** desktop shell (a webview host, *not* Tauri) and
  carries the Phoenix socket over **burble** transport for the two-player windowed
  slice. This is the churniest integration glue and lands **last**; it is not yet
  implemented.

## What is live vs. what is a seam

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Deterministic definition-as-data sim (Ghost Lobby) | **Live**, test-covered |
| Multi-floor Exchange House building runtime | **Live**, test-covered |
| 2.5D side-on renderer (multi-floor row-stacking ready) | **Live** |
| Grounded network / derived fixtures / power cascade | **Live**, test-covered |
| Actor archetype + modifier registry ("Billy as data") | **Live**, test-covered |
| Session relay (Elixir, relay-only lockstep) | **Live** |
| Moletaire companion | Landed module — **seam, not yet wired into the sim** |
| UMS content load (`load_building` / `load_actor_pack`) | **Live** load points; generator is UMS-side |
| gossamer host + burble transport (ADR-0006) | **Design-accepted, deferred** |
