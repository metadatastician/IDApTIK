# ADR-0003: Engine strategy — engine-agnostic core, Bevy + Fyrox as frontends

- Status: Accepted (evaluation phase)
- Date: 2026-07-09

## Context

The brief names **both Fyrox and Bevy** as primary tools. They are competing
full Rust engines, so "use both" needs an architecture that does not fork the
game in two. At the same time, the README's north star is unambiguous: **Rust
owns gameplay truth.** The network simulation the hacker plays against — devices,
zones, routing, DNS, traceroute, power, trace timers, alerts — is game logic, not
rendering.

## Decision

1. **Keep gameplay truth in an engine-agnostic core crate** (`idaptik-core`)
   with no dependency on Bevy or Fyrox. This holds the network/topology model,
   the simulation, movement rules, and the authoritative state that Elixir
   coordinates (ADR-0002). It is `no_render` and unit-testable in isolation.
2. **Treat Bevy and Fyrox as interchangeable frontends** over that core, each in
   its own crate (`idaptik-bevy`, `idaptik-fyrox`), during an evaluation
   phase. Both are pulled by Cargo — they are crates, not toolchains (ADR-0001).
3. **Pick one at the end of the Envelope milestone**, recorded in a follow-up
   ADR, judged on: 2D + UI ergonomics (this is a 2D platformer with a lot of
   diegetic UI — terminals, network desktops, popups), editor/tooling value
   (Fyrox ships a scene editor; Bevy leans code-first), Wasm story, and iteration
   speed. Until then, whichever frontend is behind must not accrete game logic —
   logic belongs in core.

The FFI/ABI surface (`idaptik-ffi`, exercised with Zig/Idris2 per ADR-0001)
also targets the core, not a specific engine.

## Consequences

- "Both engines" is honoured without maintaining two games: the frontends are
  thin, the core is the product.
- The eventual engine decision is cheap, because switching frontends does not
  touch gameplay truth or the multiplayer boundary.
- Workspace shape this implies (scaffolded in a later change):
  `crates/idaptik-core`, `crates/idaptik-bevy`, `crates/idaptik-fyrox`,
  `crates/idaptik-ffi`.
